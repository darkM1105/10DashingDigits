<h1>"10 Dashing Digits"</h1>
<p>
    Hello!!!, and Welcome to 10 Dashing Digits. If you are new to the game, do not fear, for it is very
    simple. On the top of the game page, you will be presented with a textarea containing lots of random
    words. All you have to do is type them out correctly. However, you will not be alone. You must face
    off with a randomly selected opponent. He too will be trying to type those pesky words. Do you have
    what it takes to win? Beware!!! Two go in, but only one comes out. Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha. lol jk. In reality,
    your opponent is not a real person. Rather it is just a representation of when somebody else played
    the game, and how they did during the session. To answer your question...no, this isn't probably a
    cheap ripoff of another typing game website called 10 Fast Fingers. Where would you get that idea
    from? Well, enough with this rambling. If you want to start playing the game, click <a href="/game">here</a>
    . If you are super duper special whereas you're and admin, click <a href="/admin.jsp">here</a>.
